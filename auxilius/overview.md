# Achievo

Achievo is a time tracker for employees to log the hours they work on various projects and business activities.
The goal of Achievo is to support the finance department in understanding where hours are spent so that the company
can steer it's own activities and employees. In addition internal activities, employees also do project work
for external customers. Based on the data collected by Achievo, the company can generate invoices for their customers.

This is the `Lite` version of Achievo, that only has user management features.
